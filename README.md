# How to run
The game has not been compiled into a binary distribution. To run it, Python is therefore needed along with some specific packages. A virtual environment can be set up with the correct version of Python along with the needed packages using the supplied <a href="https://github.com/Sebastian-dm/pilferer/blob/master/env/roguelike.yml">yml file</a>. The specifics of which packages are needed may also be found by consulting the yml file.
